# signals-and-systems

This repository contains the implementation of a Human Activity Recognition (HAR) system using IMU sensor data. The project is structured into three main components:

har_utils – Contains the signal processing pipeline for IMU data, including filtering, feature extraction (time- and frequency-domain features), and preprocessing functions.

final_test – Handles model deployment and testing on new or unseen IMU datasets.

highacc – Contains the model training scripts, including Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier implementation, and evaluation of results on the UCI-HAR dataset, achieving high classification accuracy.
